What we need to do: check the likelihood, understand where the sum algorithm is important, implement the N-R algorithm, make a report, do checks


### To Do / checklist: 
- fully explain the steps and the mathematical basis (why does it work?)
- correct likelihood in algorithm 
    - Put in code exactly where and why
- can work with 1 booklet
- optimization: Newton-Raphson with analytical first and second derivatives (mind identification)
    - put in code exactly where we take these 
    - OR: use the NLM() function to compute the likelihoods 
- elsym: correct efficient implementation of elementary symmetric functions
- thorough checks with explanations and plots where appropriate
- a complete working implementation encapsulated in a function that accepts a dataset and returns the parameters (not just a script)
    - seems good, input = response matrix = dataset; output = betas = parameters.
- change comments in the code so it doesn't look like chatGPT
